For Windows we provide a _.setup.exe_ installer, so you need to download it from the
[releases page](https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp/releases) and follow its installation steps
(after the installation, you should see Headlamp's icon on your desktop).

*Important:* While running Headlamp, if Windows Defender prompts you about stopping the app
because it's from an unknown source, that happens because Headlamp's Windows builds are not yet
signed (we're working on it). You can still run the app by choosing "Run Anyway".
